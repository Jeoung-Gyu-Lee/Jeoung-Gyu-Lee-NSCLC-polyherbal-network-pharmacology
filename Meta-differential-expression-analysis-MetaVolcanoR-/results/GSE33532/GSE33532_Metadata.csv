The limit of blank value (which was estimated to be 5.5 on log2 scale) was defined as the 95% percentile of the expression of the ‘complete mismatch’ probe sets. The ‘complete mismatch’ probe sets were composed of the probes that failed to match both genomic sequence as well as known mRNA and EST transcripts even when up to 3 mismatches were tolerated. The disregarded probe sets were not considered in statistical analyses relevant for our manuscript.","GPL570","Michael,,Meister","michael.meister@med.uni-heidelberg.de","62213961650","STF","Thoraxklinik-Heidelberg","Roentgenstr. 1","Heidelberg","Select One","69126","Germany","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM835nnn/GSM835366/suppl/GSM835366_98_D_TK.CEL.gz","25906","69","male","mixed","lung","1B","Tumor"

GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.","GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.","Bioconductor [Gentleman et al. Genome Biology 2004] and R language [Ihaka and Gentleman. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics 1996] were used for pre-processing of the hybridizations. The microarray data was normalized and gene expression summarized by the RMA-PLM method [Bolstad et al. Quality Assessment of Affymetrix GeneChip Data in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Solutions Using R and Bioconductor, Springer 2005]. All probes on the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray were re-evaluated through a systematic comparison of probe sequences with reference sequence databases (RefSeq, EMBL, UniGene) and the available genome drafts. Out of 56,675 initial probe sets 25,906 high quality & expressed probe sets were considered for further analysis. Probe Level Model (PLM) algorithm was used to fit probe-intensity data and estimate expression of the probe sets. These considered probe sets unambiguously matched known loci, and showed expression that exceeded the estimated limit of blank (LOB) in at least 4 samples out of 100. The limit of blank value (which was estimated to be 5.5 on log2 scale) was defined as the 95% percentile of the expression of the ‘complete mismatch’ probe sets.
