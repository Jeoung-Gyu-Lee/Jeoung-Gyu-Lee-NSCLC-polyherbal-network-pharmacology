# Meta-differential-expression-analysis-MetaVolcanoR-
Differential expression analysis of microarray GEO datasets using limma. This pipeline includes sequential steps such as normalization of raw data, quality control with various plots, batch effect correction, probe-to-gene mapping, filtering of lowly expressed genes, selection of protein-coding genes, and meta-analysis using MetaVolcanoR.
